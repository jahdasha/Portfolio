					My name is Jahdasha Flagg. I am a really fun boring person. </br>

					Here's an awesome "Snapple Fact" about me. </br>
					Ready? </br>

					Very weird but true: I hate tomatoes but my favorite soup isssss... </br>
					You guessed it Tomatoe Soup. </br>
					I have a spoiled cat named Skype. (My mom named him not me) She also doesn't know how to use Skype
					nor Apple facetime. SMH MOM!

					But nevermind my mother. </br>
					She doesn't code. </br>
					I DO! </br>
					Well I try. </br>
					Okay, okay I'm learning, Happy?
